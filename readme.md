## What is

> A proxy server, also known as a "proxy" or "application-level gateway", is a computer that acts as a gateway between a local network (for example, all the computers at one company or in one building) and a larger-scale network such as the internet. [^1](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahoo)

## Proxy server (Forward Proxy)

> A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called a gateway or sometimes a tunneling proxy.

> A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources.

### Popular Proxy servers

- [squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/)
- [g3proxy](https://github.com/bytedance/g3) - HTTP/Socks/SNI/Transparent Proxy support proxy chaining, protocol inspection, MITM Interception and ICAP adaptation.

## Reverse Proxy

> A reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks such as load-balancing, authentication, decryption or caching.

## SOCKS Proxy

> SOCKS is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 additionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)

### SOCKS protocol

- [SOCKS Protocol version 5 - rfc 1928](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt)
- [SOCKS Protocol version 4](https://www.openssh.com/txt/socks4.protocol)

### Popular Implementations of SOCKS server

- [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html) - A secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic.
- [Dante](https://www.inet.no/dante/) - A free SOCKS server.
- [microsocks](https://github.com/rofl0r/microsocks) - Tiny, portable SOCKS5 server with very moderate resource usage.

## HTTP/HTTPS Proxy (HTTP tunnel)

> HTTP tunneling is used to create a network link between two computers in conditions of restricted network connectivity including firewalls, NATs and ACLs, among other restrictions. The tunnel is created by an intermediary called a proxy server which is usually located in a DMZ. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)

- [Tunnelmole](https://tunnelmole.com/) - Tunnelmole provides a public URL for a web server running locally. This can then be accessed from any device connected to the internet. In essence, Tunnelmole is a reverse proxy from the internet to your local machine, capable of handling all types of HTTP/HTTPS requests such as text, HTML, images, JavaScript, and JSON.

### HTTP Proxy protocol

- [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing

### Popular Implementations of HTTP tunnel

- [XX-Net](https://github.com/XX-net/XX-Net) - a web proxy tool
- [Tinyproxy](https://tinyproxy.github.io/) - lightweight http(s) proxy daemon
- [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) - mitmproxy is a free and open source interactive HTTPS proxy.
